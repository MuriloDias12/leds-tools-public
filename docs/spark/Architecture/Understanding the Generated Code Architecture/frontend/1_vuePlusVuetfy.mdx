In this section, we will discuss the frontend architecture generated using **Vue** and **Vuetify**.

# Versions
- <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html">Vue: 3.4.17</a>
- <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/">Vuetify: 3.5.3</a>
- <a href="https://vite.dev/">Vite: ^5.1.1</a>

# What is Vue?

Vue is a NodeJS-based framework that follows a component-based architecture. Just like React, Vue provides ways to abstract HTML — but in this case, the abstraction is done through files with Vue’s own extension: .vue.

A Vue file is structured using three main tags: template, script, and style.
- The template tag contains the HTML code.
- The script tag is used to handle logic, manage entities, and typically work with component reactivity.
- The style tag is used to define the page's styles.

# Vue VS Vuetfy VS Vite
The generated frontend relies on the participation of three main frameworks: Vue, Vuetify, and Vite.

Vue is the primary framework, meaning it is the most important in this list. It is responsible for component management, HTML preprocessing, object reactivity control, and more. Other frameworks and libraries can emerge from Vue, each serving a specific purpose.

Vuetify is one of these tools that emerge from Vue. It is essentially a collection of ready-to-use, reusable components, complete with a set of properties and useful features.

Lastly, Vite is an external tool used to optimize the development and build process of the project. With Vite, when editing code, a hot update is performed in real-time, applying only the changes made, which speeds up the development process. Additionally, when building the project, the site is optimized by Vite.
